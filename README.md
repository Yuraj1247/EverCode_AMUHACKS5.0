# RECAP AI  
### Recovery Engine for Continuous Academic Progress  

A smart academic recovery platform designed to help students realistically catch up when they fall behind.

## 🚀 Overview

RECAP AI is an adaptive academic recovery system built for students who struggle with backlog, overlapping deadlines, and academic stress.

Unlike traditional planners that simply schedule tasks, RECAP AI analyzes:

- Subjects  
- Backlog chapters  
- Deadlines  
- Available study hours  
- Learning pace  
- Stress level  

It then generates a structured, realistic catch-up plan that adjusts dynamically as the student progresses.

This is not just a timetable generator — it is a recovery intelligence system.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students often fall behind due to:

- Weak planning  
- Overlapping academic deadlines  
- Underestimating workload  
- Stress and burnout  

Most productivity tools fail because they:

- Ignore deadline pressure  
- Ignore subject difficulty  
- Ignore personal study capacity  
- Do not adapt when students miss tasks  

As a result, students create unrealistic schedules and eventually give up.

## 💡 Our Solution

RECAP AI provides a structured, adaptive recovery process:

1. Academic input collection  
2. Deadline urgency analysis  
3. Subject pressure scoring  
4. Overall recovery difficulty assessment  
5. Intelligent subject prioritization  
6. Smart daily time allocation  
7. 7-day structured catch-up plan  
8. Adaptive replanning if tasks are missed  
9. Burnout detection system  
10. Detailed analytics and progress tracking  

The system continuously recalculates and adjusts based on performance and stress trends.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1 – Student Input
Students enter:
- Subjects  
- Backlog chapters  
- Deadlines  
- Daily study hours  
- Stress level  
- Learning pace  

### Step 2 – Deadline Intelligence
The system calculates:
- Days remaining  
- Urgency score  
- Time pressure  

### Step 3 – Academic Pressure Calculation
Each subject receives a dynamic pressure score based on:
- Backlog intensity  
- Difficulty  
- Urgency  
- Stress multiplier  
- Learning pace multiplier  

### Step 4 – Recovery Difficulty Index
A normalized score (0–100) determines:
- Low recovery load  
- Moderate  
- High  
- Critical  

### Step 5 – Intelligent Plan Generation
- Subjects are ranked by priority  
- Daily study hours are distributed proportionally  
- A structured plan is generated from the next day until deadlines  
- Daily capacity limits are strictly enforced  

### Step 6 – Adaptive Intelligence
If tasks are missed:
- Work is redistributed intelligently  
- Forecast is updated  
- Burnout detection adjusts workload

## 🧠 What Makes RECAP AI Unique?

- Focuses on academic recovery, not generic scheduling  
- Combines stress-awareness with workload analysis  
- Enforces strict daily capacity limits  
- Adapts dynamically when students miss tasks  
- Provides real-time recovery forecasting  
- Includes behavioral intelligence (burnout detection)  

RECAP AI behaves like an academic recovery advisor rather than a task manager.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Designing a fair and explainable pressure scoring formula  
- Balancing urgency and workload without overloading students  
- Enforcing strict daily study hour limits  
- Preventing stale localStorage state  
- Building adaptive replanning logic  
- Creating a real calendar-based task execution system  

Through phased development and modular architecture, these challenges were solved systematically.
